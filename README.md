# email-and-calendar-event-scheduler-
this app scripts will require some setup with google forms-sheets to send email reminders and create a calendar event reminder


my idea is intially to setup a basic google sheets and create columns for email
coulmn B -subject (title)
column C -message
column D -date
column E -time

and then i wanted some sort of an input interface without having to open the entire form

so i created a google form and mapped it the scripts and mapped the columns.

now every time anyone with the link to the forms can submit an entry and that will append a new entry into the form which will do two things
create a scheduled email on the specific date and time.
create a calendar event and lasts 30 minutes from the scheduled time
